# Our Recipe Box
This fullstack web application is a recipe congregation website, as well as my 100Hours project. It allows you to
upload and save your favorite recipes!





## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose

This is a fullstack web application, with the backend written in JavaScript using Node.js.  The framework used for the backend is Express, using EJS for the View and Mongoose to access the model. 

## Optimizations

As time goes on, I will be adding various features that I have always wanted on a recipe website. First of all, I will create a floating ingredients list so that the ingredients are always visible, as well as adding a web scraper that you
can give a URL and it will grab the relevant information, and upload it to the database.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned to make sure I am editing exactly where I mean to, and to check and recheck things that I believe I fixed previously, as sometimes I may place the fix in the wrong spot.  Also, after building out the front end as well as the back end from the ground up, I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of both.
